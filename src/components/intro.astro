   Performance and scalability testing is essential to ensure that the software can handle the intended workload and maintain acceptable performance under heavy workloads. Performance testing is a systematic process to measure the software's ability to perform tasks under different conditions and to evaluate its ability to handle large numbers of users or transactions.

   Performance testing focuses on measuring the speed, capacity, stability and scalability of the software under different load conditions, such as number of concurrent users, amount of data processed, response time and error rate. Scalability testing focuses on measuring how the software can handle an increase in workload and how the software can be scaled to handle a larger load.
